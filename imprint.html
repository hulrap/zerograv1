      <h2>Terms of Use for TIM.theoriesinmind e.V.</h2>
      <br>
      <h1>NFT Collection</h1>
      <p> These Terms of Use ("Terms") are a legally binding agreement between you and TIM.theoriesinmind e.V. ("TIM.theoriesinmind e.V.," "we," or "us") and set forth the terms for your use of TIM.theoriesinmind e.V.'s NFT collection's website located at <a href="#">https://www.zerograv.xyz</a> (the "Site") and the limited services made available through the Site as described herein (the Site and services, collectively, the "Services").</p>
      <p> ARBITRATION NOTICE AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER: EXCEPT FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF DISPUTES DESCRIBED IN SECTIONS 11 or 12 BELOW, YOU AGREE THAT DISPUTES BETWEEN YOU AND TIM.theoriesinmind e.V. WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING, INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION AND YOU WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT OR CLASS-WIDE ARBITRATION.</p>
      <p>BY USING THE SITE OR SERVICES, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH THESE TERMS, YOU MAY NOT USE THE SITE OR SERVICES.</p>
      <p>For clarity, these Terms do not govern your use of other websites or services provided by TIM.theoriesinmind e.V., TIME USA LLC, or its affiliates.</p>
      <h4>NFT Minting and Purchasing</h4>
      <div class="margin_left">
        <p><strong>Website Description:</strong> The TIM.theoriesinmind e.V. website at https://www.zerograv.xyz allows users the opportunity to purchase unique Ethereum blockchain-tracked, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) referred to as "NFTs." These NFTs serve as digital collectibles and are originally minted by TIM.theoriesinmind e.V. These Terms constitute a legally binding agreement between you and TIM.theoriesinmind e.V. and set forth the terms for your use of the Site and the Services.<br>
          <strong> Allowlist:</strong> The minting of NFTs will be available through an allowlist on a first-come-first-serve basis. Please note that being on the allowlist does not guarantee the right to mint an NFT. <br>
          <strong> Third-Party Services: </strong>Transactions made through the Services are managed and confirmed on the Ethereum blockchain and are processed by third-party vendors (collectively, "Third Party Vendors") rather than by TIM.theoriesinmind e.V. For example, to initiate the minting and purchase of an NFT, and to display, store, trade, and sell your NFT, you may need to set up an electronic wallet with a provider such as Metamask (provided by ConsenSys Software Inc.) and create an account with a marketplace like OpenSea (Ozone Networks, Inc.). By using the Services for any of the above activities, you agree to the terms of service and privacy policies of these Third Party Vendors, including Metamask and OpenSea. <br>
          <strong> Ownership:</strong> You acknowledge and agree that TIM.theoriesinmind e.V. (or its licensors) owns all legal rights, titles, and interests in and to the content of the Site and the NFTs. The license to NFTs is CC0 (Creative Commons Zero), and any rights you may have in the NFTs are not limited. <br>
          <strong>Purchase Terms:</strong> You may initiate a purchase of NFTs by selecting "Mint" on the Site. Each buyer will receive a random NFT from the collection, which will be revealed upon the end of the minting period. All purchases made through the Site are final and non-refundable. You may make purchases using cryptocurrencies that we may choose to accept. <br>
          <strong> Payment Responsibilities</strong>: You are responsible for all payments, fees, and costs associated with engaging in any transactions involving NFTs, including, without limitation, the purchase price and transaction fees.<br>
          Secondary Sales: You may have the limited right to sell or transfer your NFTs on the OpenSea marketplace. We do not monitor or control any marketplace purchases or sales beyond those on the Site.</p>
      </div>
      <h4>Limited License</h4>
      <p>In connection with your purchase of one or more NFTs and subject to your compliance with these Terms, TIM.theoriesinmind e.V. grants you an unrestricted CC0 license to use and distribute the NFTs as you see fit.</p>
      <h4>Disclaimer of Warranties</h4>
      <p>IF YOU CHOOSE TO USE THE SITE OR SERVICES, YOU DO SO VOLUNTARILY AND AT YOUR SOLE RISK. THE SITE AND SERVICES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS," AND TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMISSIBLE UNDER APPLICABLE LAWS, WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES OR OTHER TERMS OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED.</p>
      <h4>Indemnification</h4>
      <p>You shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless TIM.theoriesinmind e.V., its affiliates, and licensors, as well as their respective officers, agents, directors, representatives, contractors, and employees, from and against any claims, suits, demands, actions, losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, penalties, fines, expenses, and other costs arising from your breach or alleged breach of these Terms.</p>
      <h4>Limitation of Liability</h4>
      <p>In no event will TIM.theoriesinmind e.V. be liable to you for any special, incidental, exemplary, indirect, punitive, or consequential damages with respect to the subject matter of these Terms.</p>
      <h4>Assignment</h4>
      <p>TIM.theoriesinmind e.V. will have the unrestricted right to assign these Terms and any of its rights and obligations hereunder. This Agreement is personal to you and shall not be assigned or transferred by you.</p>
      <h4>Remedies</h4>
      <p>Your rights and remedies in the event of any breach of these Terms are strictly limited to the right, if any, to recover damages. You will not be entitled to seek any equitable relief.</p>
      <h4>Arbitration / Dispute Resolution For Residents Outside Austria.</h4>
      <p>In the event of a dispute, you and TIM.theoriesinmind e.V. agree to engage in a dialogue in an attempt to resolve the dispute. After a 60-day period, if the dispute remains unresolved, we agree to resolve the dispute through arbitration in accordance with Austrian law (Vienna).</p>
      <h4>No Rights of Third Parties</h4>
      <p>You agree that there are no third-party beneficiaries to these Terms.</p>
      <h4>Miscellaneous Terms</h4>
