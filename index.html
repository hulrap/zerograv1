Put simply, the bigger the swings, the higher the VOLATILITY, and thus potential risk. IMPLIED VOLATILITY is a means to evaluate probabilities of future market sentiment and uncertainty. Typically, VOLATILITY serves to insure against (hedging) and/or exploit (speculation) calculated risk.<br>
              <br>
              The term is increasingly used outside of finance to indicate political, economic, ecological, social, emotional and other crises. VOLATILITY is produced, in fact, by manufacturing and unleashing risks on populations to swing public opinion or for other gain.<br>
              <br>
              On the other hand, there are cultural and artistic practices that engage with VOLATILITY in creative and collective ways. According to the sociologist and dancer, Randy Martin, BOARDING is one of its outstanding examples.<br>

              THE DERIVATIVE CONDITION diagnosis that the future emerges today within a DERIVATIVE PARADIGM, i.e. the technological implementation of algorithmic processes that leverage the dynamic recalibration of contingent claims at present.  
              As a technology, however, the DERIVATIVE is not intrinsically linked to capitalism and should therefore be analyzed for its potential to leverage reciprocal forms of wealth distribution and preservation.<br>

            <p class="fw100">A popular trading strategy but challenging to implement on a consistent basis because its approach to volatility is simplistic and highs/lows can only be known after the fact, and not while trading.</p>
          </div>
          <div id="dynamically" style="display:none">
            <h2>Dynamic hedging</h2>
            <p class="fw100">A derivative hedging strategy which dynamically adjusts risk exposures to limit downside risk while maintaining upside flexibility in changing market conditions.<br>
              <br>
              Beyond metaphor, DYNAMIC HEDGING is not unlike physical activities, such as BOARDING, where the body performatively "recalibrates" its balance by complex flow coordination. </p>

          <div id="liquidity" style="display:none">
            <h2>Liquidity</h2>
            <p class="fw100">Generally, LIQUIDITY refers to the ease and efficiency of converting an asset into cash. Concerning financial markets, LIQUIDITY relates to trading volume, i.e. how easily assets can be bought or sold. When the spread between the bid and ask prices tightens, the market is more liquid, and vice versa. Due to the paramount importance conceded to financial markets, market liquidity has become an unfortunate political issue to be guaranteed at all costs.<br>
              <br>
              LIQUIDITY can also be conceived as the equivalent to the experience of a flow state. Randy Martin's assertion, "finance works through flows. It moves production inside of circulation" resonates with non-financial risk-taking activities, such as BOARDING. The pleasure of being in the moment is "produced" by the challenge of mastery and self-fulfillment, and hence the motivation to engage in training cycles.<br>

          <div id="arbitrage" style="display:none">
            <h2>Arbitrage</h2>
            <p class="fw100">The opportunity of risk-free profit by exploiting, for instance, the price variation of one asset in different markets. ARBITRAGE often uses sophisticated strategies to detect and trade market inefficiencies. It ranks among the most applied methods in finance.</p>

          <div id="play" style="display:none">
            <h2 class="text_left">Rad play on the level of resonating volatilities</h2>
            <p class="fw100">To emphasize the potential for a cultural turn to make sense of collective, creative and artistic volatility. In contrast to the prevailing neoliberal market view, formulated e.g. by the main options marketplace, the CBOE, with the definition of its Volatility Index (VIX) futures product: "a pure play on the level of expected volatility."</p>

        <p class="fw100">As a technology, however, the DERIVATIVE is not intrinsically linked to capitalism and should therefore be analyzed for its potential to leverage reciprocal forms of wealth distribution and preservation.</p>
        <p class="fw100">Moreover, the term's wider conceptual and practical spectrum, and its significant value beyond finance, is increasingly explored by scholars, artists and cultural practitioners.</p>

        <h2 class="text_left">Buy low<br>
          and sell high</h2>
        <p class="fw100">A popular trading strategy but challenging to implement on a consistent basis because its approach to volatility is simplistic and highs/lows can only be known after the fact, and not while trading.</p>

        <h2>Dynamic hedging</h2>
        <p class="fw100">A derivative hedging strategy which dynamically adjusts risk exposures to limit downside risk while maintaining upside flexibility in changing market conditions.</p>
        <p class="fw100">Beyond metaphor, DYNAMIC HEDGING is not unlike physical activities, such as BOARDING, where the body performatively "recalibrates" its balance by complex flow coordination. </p>

        <h2>Liquidity</h2>
        <p class="fw100">Generally, LIQUIDITY refers to the ease and efficiency of converting an asset into cash. Concerning financial markets, LIQUIDITY relates to trading volume, i.e. how easily assets can be bought or sold. When the spread between the bid and ask prices tightens, the market is more liquid, and vice versa. Due to the paramount importance conceded to financial markets, market liquidity has become an unfortunate political issue to be guaranteed at all costs.</p>
        <p class="fw100">LIQUIDITY can also be conceived as the equivalent to the experience of a flow state. Randy Martin's assertion, "finance works through flows. It moves production inside of circulation" resonates with non-financial risk-taking activities, such as BOARDING. The pleasure of being in the moment is "produced" by the challenge of mastery and self-fulfillment, and hence the motivation to engage in training cycles.</p>

        <h2>Arbitrage</h2>
        <p class="fw100">The opportunity of risk-free profit by exploiting, for instance, the price variation of one asset in different markets. ARBITRAGE often uses sophisticated strategies to detect and trade market inefficiencies. It ranks among the most applied methods in finance.</p>

        <h2 class="text_left">Rad play on the level of resonating volatilities</h2>
        <p class="fw100">To emphasize the potential for a cultural turn to make sense of collective, creative and artistic volatility. In contrast to the prevailing neoliberal market view, formulated e.g. by the main options marketplace, the CBOE, with the definition of its Volatility Index (VIX) futures product: "a pure play on the level of expected volatility."</p>
