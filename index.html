It melds skateboard components and inscriptions into an NFT collection that skillfully bridges the worlds of boarding culture and finance.

      <div class="col-2-3 justify"> <font style class="zero">Understanding our art</font>
        <p> Zero Gravity conceptually allows objects to levitate, unbound by any connection to larger systems, entities, or objects—representing a form of material liberation. However, our artworks delve deeper, embodying the essence of speculative logics rather than escaping it. They mimic how gravity itself is indifferent to its own force. Incorporating skateboards into this realm of 'non-gravity' presents a material challenge: although skateboarding inherently defies gravity through its risky tricks and movements, it is ultimately tied to the physical world's gravitational pull. Therefore, performing zero-gravity 1080 spins on the blockchain becomes a symbolic act. The fluidity of tokenized markets, whether liquid or otherwise, serves as our playground, akin to ramps in skateboarding or emptied pools to be occupied.</p>
        <p><font style class="zero">1080 zero grav</font> explores some of the striking parallels between boarding culture and crypto/finance. The art project transforms the NFT space into a participative ecosystem that feels like a digital skatepark in which volatility, arbitrage, and leverage turn into aesthetic and dynamic forms of visual movement.</p>
        <p><font style class="zero">1080 zero grav</font> takes skateboarding from the physical space to the blockchain. The NFT collection celebrates boarding as the art of volatile balancing, from asphalt surfing to street skateboarding, and on to crypto boarding!</p>

            <p class="fw100">Technically, VOLATILITY is the statistical measure of an asset’s dispersion of returns derived from the size of price swings around its mean price. Put simply, the bigger the swings, the higher the VOLATILITY, and thus potential risk. IMPLIED VOLATILITY is a means to evaluate probabilities of future market sentiment and uncertainty. Typically, VOLATILITY serves to insure against (hedging) and/or exploit (speculation) calculated risk.<br>
              <br>
              The term is increasingly used outside of finance to indicate political, economic, ecological, social, emotional and other crises. VOLATILITY is produced, in fact, by manufacturing and unleashing risks on populations to swing public opinion or for other gain.<br>
              <br>
              On the other hand, there are cultural and artistic practices that engage with VOLATILITY in creative and collective ways. According to the sociologist and dancer, Randy Martin, BOARDING is one of its outstanding examples.<br>

              <br>

            <h2>Liquidity</h2>
            <p class="fw100">Generally, LIQUIDITY refers to the ease and efficiency of converting an asset into cash. Concerning financial markets, LIQUIDITY relates to trading volume, i.e. how easily assets can be bought or sold. When the spread between the bid and ask prices tightens, the market is more liquid, and vice versa. Due to the paramount importance conceded to financial markets, market liquidity has become an unfortunate political issue to be guaranteed at all costs.<br>
              <br>
              LIQUIDITY can also be conceived as the equivalent to the experience of a flow state. Randy Martin's assertion, "finance works through flows. It moves production inside of circulation" resonates with non-financial risk-taking activities, such as BOARDING. The pleasure of being in the moment is "produced" by the challenge of mastery and self-fulfillment, and hence the motivation to engage in training cycles.<br>

            <p class="fw100">The opportunity of risk-free profit by exploiting, for instance, the price variation of one asset in different markets. ARBITRAGE often uses sophisticated strategies to detect and trade market inefficiencies. It ranks among the most applied methods in finance.</p>

        <h2>Dynamic hedging</h2>
        <p class="fw100">A derivative hedging strategy which dynamically adjusts risk exposures to limit downside risk while maintaining upside flexibility in changing market conditions.</p>
        <p class="fw100">Beyond metaphor, DYNAMIC HEDGING is not unlike physical activities, such as BOARDING, where the body performatively "recalibrates" its balance by complex flow coordination. </p>

        <h2>Liquidity</h2>
        <p class="fw100">Generally, LIQUIDITY refers to the ease and efficiency of converting an asset into cash. Concerning financial markets, LIQUIDITY relates to trading volume, i.e. how easily assets can be bought or sold. When the spread between the bid and ask prices tightens, the market is more liquid, and vice versa. Due to the paramount importance conceded to financial markets, market liquidity has become an unfortunate political issue to be guaranteed at all costs.</p>
        <p class="fw100">LIQUIDITY can also be conceived as the equivalent to the experience of a flow state. Randy Martin's assertion, "finance works through flows. It moves production inside of circulation" resonates with non-financial risk-taking activities, such as BOARDING. The pleasure of being in the moment is "produced" by the challenge of mastery and self-fulfillment, and hence the motivation to engage in training cycles.</p>

        <h2>Arbitrage</h2>
        <p class="fw100">The opportunity of risk-free profit by exploiting, for instance, the price variation of one asset in different markets. ARBITRAGE often uses sophisticated strategies to detect and trade market inefficiencies. It ranks among the most applied methods in finance.</p>

        <h2 class="text_left">Rad play on the level of resonating volatilities</h2>
        <p class="fw100">To emphasize the potential for a cultural turn to make sense of collective, creative and artistic volatility. In contrast to the prevailing neoliberal market view, formulated e.g. by the main options marketplace, the CBOE, with the definition of its Volatility Index (VIX) futures product: "a pure play on the level of expected volatility."</p>
